# Node.js projet template
This is a node project template for me to create projects with. It's built upon "Node.js Bulletproof architecture"
## Development

We use `node` version `14.9.0`

```
nvm install 14.9.0
```

```
nvm use 14.9.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
